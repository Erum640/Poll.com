<H2>Characteristics of good online polls</H2>
<OL>
<li><H3>Right questions<h3></li>
Although the definition of ‘right’ is subjective, the general best practice is to avoid asking sensitive questions - questions that might hurt somebody’s sentiments or religious beliefs. Use words that convey the meaning clearly.

Phrase the poll questions such that it extracts the exact information that you need, and avoids the possibility of ambiguous response. The options should also be mutually exclusive. In case you think that the respondent will not be able to select a clear answer, give them an option to express their non-decisiveness. Do not use unfamiliar acronyms and abbreviations.

Example: If you are a travel agency and want to predict which will be the most popular holiday destination for the next season, then give out options that are geographically quite different and will help make better a decision.

<H2>How to select between online polls and online surveys?</H2>

Based on the outcome of the poll, you can change your future strategy or test if you are going in the right direction. It can help you to be more confident about your performance so far. Surveys, too, help you get valuable inputs from your audience and help you serve them with better products and services.

But, if online polls and surveys are so similar, what is the difference between poll and survey?
<OL>

<LI><H3>Time</H3></LI>
If you want to make the decision right now, online polls are the right choice. But if you can wait for all respondents to answer questions, then you should go for surveys. Online polls are likely to gather higher responses, as they take very little time to respond. Surveys may take more than a few minutes of a respondent’s time. Hence, somebody might delay answering it. In such cases, online polls make a better choice.

<LI><H3>Decision</H3></LI>
Surveys are for making decisions and getting insights. Polls, on the other hand, are used for getting a sneak peek. Surveys often employ programming like branching, scoring, quotas, criteria, etc, whereas polls don’t test the logical behavior of the respondents. Also, if you want to force them to answer a few mandatory questions, it is possible through surveys, but it is not possible in the case of online polls.

Another aspect is how important decision you want to make. If you just want to get the pulse of the situation, go for an online poll. But if you want to know the details and gather statistical data, go for online surveys.

<LI><H3>Number of questions</H3></LI>
Online polls are short, typically one question long, whereas surveys consist of many questions which are related to each other. For instance, customer satisfaction survey consists of many questions. Had it been a poll, it would have been a simple yes/no question, asking whether you are satisfied with our services. Poll questions are one-liner and ask the respondent’s opinion very directly. Survey questions can be a bit longer.

<LI><H3>Control over respondents</H3></LI>
Surveys offer you the flexibility to select a specific number of respondents from a specific demographic. You can ask qualifying questions and only allow those respondents who fit the criteria to finish the survey. Online polls are presented to everybody and do not offer a mechanism to filter respondents based on specific criteria.
